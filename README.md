# Task Slaughter

Coding Dojo Hackaton Project (Python Stack).

The idea of our group was to create something to help people to organize their day, creating tasks and checking their location with Google Maps and sending the main info to your phone as SMS, using Twilio. The project was developed in 1 week, Hackaton style and presented to all instructors and students.

We use: Python, mySQL Workbench, Google Maps API, Twilio API and Pylot(MVC framework used on Coding Dojo)

#Won 1st place! :)
